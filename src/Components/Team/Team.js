        <h1>Our Story </h1>
        <p>
          We're a Black-owned, full-service digital marketing agency. We started
          in 2010 as a local SEO and video marketing company, and we thought we
          were headed to the promised land with that business model. By 2013, we
          realized that the industry was changing. It was taking more and more
          effort to win online, and we were trying everything, using every tool,
          and still coming up short with our clients.
        </p>
        <p>We knew we needed to pivot.</p>

              While researching, we discovered HubSpot and were convinced they
              were the solution to our problem of being an agency in an evolving
              digital landscape. During a conversation with HubSpot, we were
              told, "No. You aren't a good fit to be a HubSpot Partner." Turns
              out HubSpot REALLY knows their buyer persona, and we had a lot of
              growing to do. Thankfully, when we went to an exclusive party at
              Inbound in 2015, we ran into the salesperson who told us "No."
              After two years of hard work and commitment, our co-founder
              Darrell had the opportunity to go up to him and say, "Hey, by the
              way, Yokel Local is a HubSpot Partner now." This story is even
              referenced in the book Inbound Organization by Dan Tyre and Todd
